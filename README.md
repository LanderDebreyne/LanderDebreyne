### Hi, I'm Lander Debreyne ðŸ‘‹
Student, currently in my 2nd year of my M.Sc. of Computer Science @kuleuven.

# 2023

## Thesis (In progress)
Doing my master's thesis on extending a formal system related to effect handler oriented programming. (Related to https://github.com/yallop/effects-bibliography)

## Projects 
#### Chess engines
- Low level, requires correct and efficient usage of memory
- Requires knowledge of datastructures
- Involves complex algorithms
###### Barebones Chess Engine (C++) [source](https://github.com/LanderDebreyne/0xChess)
###### Chess Engine (C++) (Closed source)
Want to do Barebones Chess Engine in Rust this year

#### Raytracer (Rust) [source](https://github.com/LanderDebreyne/rust-raytracer)
- Low level, requires correct and efficient usage of memory
- Requires knowledge of datastructures
Ray tracer is not fully featured at all but can't be asked to work in this as I don't have the time and the opportunity cost is too high imo.

## Projects I would do right now if I had time (Indicative of current interests)
#### Semantic search application
Make a generic semantic search application. 
- Embed a body of text using a LLM
- Make semantic search on this body text using LLM.

#### Chess transformer model
Train a transformer model on a body of high level robot chess games (3500+ elo).  
I expect this to model to perform very poorly as a chess engine mainly because I expect a lot of illegal moves.   
Seems fun to train this anyway...   
Might need some interesting modifications on the model architecture as the relevant context is important? (All previous moves in the game are relevant).    
Application if this works decently (3000+ elo) could be fast full game analysis of chess games.   

# 2021-2022
#### Haskell parser and interpreters (Closed source)

#### Non-deterministic generative art (Not AI-assisted)
